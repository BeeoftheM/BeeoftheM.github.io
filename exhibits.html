The battleship<br>participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 during WW1 and was<br>given to Britain when WW1 ended, and was used for scrap in the 1920s.<br>The bell was removed from the ship and put on display in the Directors<br>Corridor at Albion Works.

<p><font size="4" color="11711c" style = "font-family:Grandview Display">Crossley Gas Engine: This was made by Crossley Brothers Ltd in<br>Manchester in 1915. It drove a small rod and bar rolling mill on<br>Penistone Road belonging to George Clark and remained in use in<br>Sheffield until 1970. Gas engines were developed in the 1860s to<br>make a better way to provide power and drive machines. Crossley<br>Brothers became one of the best-known builders of gas engines in<br>the UK. This engine represents the largest single cylinder engine<br>manufactured by the Crossleys, and is a rare survivor of its type.
